# Hi, I'm AT ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate in computational chemistry, passionate about integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning to advance molecular modeling, drug discovery, and materials science. My expertise includes Python, RDKit, PySCF, and scikit-learn, with a focus on developing innovative computational tools.

ðŸ”¬ **Current Work**: Building a GitHub portfolio of open-source projects to explore AI-driven methodologies in cheminformatics and quantum chemistry. Check out my repositories for projects on molecular property prediction, quantum chemistry automation, and fragment-based drug design.

ðŸ’¼ **Background**: PhD in Computational Chemistry, PDRA at Newcastle University, specializing in drug design, molecular dynamics, QSAR modeling.

ðŸ“š **Projects** (Coming Soon):
- Molecular Property Prediction with Machine Learning
- Automated Quantum Chemistry Pipeline with AI
- Fragment-Based Drug Design Tool

âš¡ **Fun Fact**: Iâ€™m intrigued by philosophical questions like solipsismâ€”can we trust our computational models to reflect reality, or are they just projections of our code? ðŸ˜„ #CompChem #AI

Stay tuned for updates as I share my projects and insights!
